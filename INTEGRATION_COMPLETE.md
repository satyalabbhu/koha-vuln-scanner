🚨 URGENT: Database Security Issue

What happened: We found a way hackers could access your library's database 
through the login page.

What's at risk: Patron information, including names, addresses, and borrowing 
history could be stolen.

What to do: Contact your IT support immediately to update the software. 
This should be fixed within 24 hours.
