## 📊 What the Reports Look Like

### Before (Technical):
```
CVE-2023-1234: SQL injection vulnerability in login.php allows 
authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL queries (CVSS 7.5)
```

### After (Librarian-Friendly):
```
🚨 URGENT: Database Security Issue

What happened: Hackers could access your library's database through the login page.

What's at risk: Patron information including names, addresses, and borrowing history.

What to do: Contact IT support immediately to update software within 24 hours.

Priority: CRITICAL - Handle today
```

## 🔧 Optional: Add Your LLaMA Model

If you want even better AI analysis:

### Option 1: Quick Setup
```bash
# Install LLaMA support
pip install llama-cpp-python

# Download a model (example)
wget https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin

# Configure path in llm_config.json
```

### Option 2: Use Your Existing LLaMA
If you already have LLaMA installed:
1. Edit `llm_config.json` 
2. Set your model path: `"model_path": "/path/to/your/llama-model.gguf"`
3. Restart the app
